> Discord RPC for ROBLOX using the Presence API.

#### 🏠 [Homepage](https://discoblox.daangamesdg.tk/)

## ℹ Install and Usage

The installation is quite simple, you download the latest release setup.exe and run it. The app is only available for Windows. After you ran the installer, the app should be ready and working. Make sure you have your Discord account connected to ROBLOX via [BloxLink](https://blox.link/) otherwise the app will close itself because there is no user found.

DiscoBlox has an auto-updater, it will notify you when a new update has been released. The auto-updater will automatically also download and install the new update.

## 💻 Install and Usage (dev version)

Make sure you have NodeJS installed. Clone the app or download the zip, After that install the dependencies using `npm install / yarn install` via the terminal. Use the "dev" script only when you want to work on the presence part of the system, use the "start" script for the Electron part.
